I am a doctoral candidate in the [intelligent robotics group](http://irobotics.aalto.fi/) at [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/) under supervision of [Ville Kyrki](https://people.aalto.fi/index.html?profilepage=isfor#!Ville_Kyrki). I recieved my BSc. in Automation and Systems Technology in 2014 and MSc. in Space Science and Technology in 2016 from Aalto University.

In my research I focus on applying machine learning techniques to learn complex control strategies for dynamical systems. I am particularly interested in data driven learning which allows robots to learn interesting patterns from the data.
